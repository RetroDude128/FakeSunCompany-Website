<p>The Fake Sun Company was founded in 1991. The founder was Sam, U Newton.<br>
Some people, especially "scientists", believe that Sam, U Newton is a<br>
conspiracy theoriest. But our reseachers say that the "scientists" are<br>
 really lizard people Originating from the planet CBX 128 as we know the truth<br>

<hr>Our website had been closed down in 10/8/2001 due to some connections that we caused 9/11.<br>
The court said we weren't the true cause of 9/11 back in 1/30/2002 but there were still some<br>
 controversial claims about us. The controversy ended after people realized it was total garbage.<br>
In 2/25/2021. We later reopened the website for The Fake Sun Company. But we're keeping the old style to mantain compatablity for older PCs</p
